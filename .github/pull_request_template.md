<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:
1. Consider creating this PR as draft: https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

> ### 🚨 Branch strategy — read before opening this PR
>
> The v2 refactor has landed: the old `v2` branch is now **merged into `main`**, and `main` is the **active v2 development line** (v1 and v2 code coexist — expect large, breaking changes).
>
> - **v2 work** (features, refactors, optimizations) → target **`main`** (the default base).
> - **v1 maintenance** (critical user-facing bug fixes only) → branch from and target **`v1`**, _not_ `main`.
>
> Before doing v2 work, read `docs/references/data/` to see which subsystems are being replaced, and watch for `@deprecated` markers — they flag code being deleted.
