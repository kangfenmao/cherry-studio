/**
 * File IPC type contracts
 *
 * Defines the parameter and return types for File IPC operations.
 *
 * File IPC is the home for **all** file operations that need FS IO or main-side
 * computation — both mutations (create / rename / delete / move / write / trash)
 * and reads that reach past the DB (content read, dangling probe, path resolution,
 * safe URL, dialogs, streams, `open`). DataApi is kept strictly to pure SQL
 * queries; anything that would touch `fs.stat`, `resolvePhysicalPath`, or
 * `DanglingCache` belongs here instead.
 *
 * These types are shared between main (handler implementation) and
 * preload (method signatures exposed to renderer).
 *
 * ## Unified access via FileHandle
 *
 * Most operations accept `FileHandle` (tagged union) so consumers don't have
 * to pick between "route through the entry system" and "hit the FS directly"
 * at the type-signature level — they encode the choice in the handle instead.
 * The handler dispatches:
 * - `{ kind: 'entry', entryId }` → FileManager method (entry-aware)
 * - `{ kind: 'path', path }`     → `@main/utils/file/*` direct (entry-agnostic)
 *
 * Operations that only make sense against a FileEntry row (trash, rename,
 * enrichment queries, etc.) take `FileEntryId` directly.

 * ## Why a `source` discriminator union?
 *
 * `name` and `ext` are display metadata. They can sometimes be derived from
 * the content source, but not always. Rather than taking them all as optional
 * and letting callers silently pass redundant (or contradictory) values, we
 * enumerate the four content sources and type-gate the fields that each one
 * can or cannot derive:
 *
 * | source   | name derivation          | ext derivation              | caller must pass  |
 * |----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
 * | `path`   | `basename(path)`         | `extname(path)`             | — (path only)     |
 * | `url`    | URL tail / CD header     | URL suffix / Content-Type   | — (url only)      |
 * | `base64` | no origin                | mime → ext lookup           | `name?` (UX)      |
 * | `bytes`  | no origin                | no origin                   | `name`, `ext`     |
 *
 * "Can derive" ⇒ the field is **absent** from that branch — preventing
 * callers from accidentally passing a `name` that disagrees with `basename(path)`.
 * "Cannot derive" ⇒ the field is **required** (or optional-with-fallback for
 * UX names, where the caller has a legitimate choice).
 *
 * See `file-arch-problems-response.md` for the full rationale (extension of A-7).

/**
 * Params for ensuring an entry exists for a user-provided (external) path.
 * Pure upsert semantics on `externalPath`: if an entry with the same path
 * exists, it is returned as-is; otherwise a new row is inserted. External
 * rows carry no stored `size` (always `null`); live values come from
 * `getMetadata`. External entries cannot be trashed, so no "restore" branch
 * is possible.
 *
 * ## Canonicalization stays on the main side (by design)
 *
 * `externalPath` is intentionally typed as raw `FilePath` rather than
 * `CanonicalExternalPath`. The asymmetry is deliberate:
 *
 * - **Renderer has no canonicalize use case.** It never compares paths
 *   for dedup (the DB-level `UNIQUE(externalPath)` index does that
 *   after `ensureExternalEntry`), never derives a canonical projection,
 *   and never uses paths as join keys. Every path the renderer holds
 *   either flows back to main (for an IPC call) or feeds a system API
 *   that itself accepts arbitrary user paths.
 * - **Canonicalization implementation is main-only.**
 *   `canonicalizeExternalPath` (`src/main/services/file/utils/pathResolver.ts`)
 *   depends on main-only modules (realpath / NFC / case-fold). Asking the
 *   renderer to canonicalize would either duplicate that logic or
 *   require an extra IPC hop per call — no upside for either choice.
 * - **The brand is already protected by a project rule, not by JSDoc.**
 *   `fileEntry.ts` makes the construction discipline explicit: only the
 *   `canonicalizeExternalPath` factory may produce `CanonicalExternalPath`;
 *   production code MUST NEVER `as`-cast into the brand. Code that
 *   bypasses the gate violates the rule, not just an inline comment —
 *   PR review catches it the same way it catches any other rule break.
 *
 * **Why not extend the brand to the IPC boundary** (e.g. a `RawExternalPath`
 * brand on the param): the renderer would have to `as`-cast `string →
 * RawExternalPath` at the call site, which is itself a violation of the
 * same "no production `as`-cast into brands" rule. The proposal therefore
 * trades one boundary's discipline for another's, without adding actual
 * enforcement; meanwhile dev / test ergonomics get worse at every call
 * site. The four current main consumers (FileManager.ensureExternalEntry,
 * FileManager.rename, `internal/entry/rename.ts`, `internal/entry/create.ts`)
 * already canonicalize before any DB lookup, and Phase 2 consumers join
 * that pattern via code review at the same sites.
 *
 * Skipping canonicalization silently misses entries on case-insensitive
 * filesystems and after symlink resolution — which is why the gate exists
 * at all.

  // ─── K. Orphan Sweep ───
  //
  // User-triggered cleanup pass. There is no startup auto-run; the cleanup UI
  // is the only consumer.

  /**
   * Run both the FS-level orphan sweep (architecture §10) and the DB-level
   * orphan-ref / entry sweep (§7 Layer 3) concurrently. Returns once both
   * settle, with the DB sweep's discriminated outcome surfaced through the
   * report's `outcome` field (`'completed'` / `'partial'` / `'failed'`).
   *
   * The FS sweep's outcome is logged but does not bleed into the returned
   * report — DB-only state is what the cleanup UI consumes.
   *
   * @phase 2 — wired in Batch 0 (`IpcChannel.File_RunSweep` →
   * `FileManager.registerIpcHandlers`)
