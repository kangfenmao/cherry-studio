/**
 * File entry entity types
 *
 * Zod schemas for runtime validation of FileEntry records.
 * FileEntry is a flat list of Cherry-managed files (no tree structure).
 *
 * `FileEntry` is a **discriminated union on `origin`**: each variant declares
 * only the fields it owns, so consumers narrow naturally on `origin` instead
 * of dancing around nullable columns. The DB row layer keeps every column
 * physically (see "DB row vs Business Object" below).
 *
 * - `internal`: Cherry owns the content, stored at `{userData}/Data/Files/{id}.{ext}`.
 *   `name` / `ext` / `size` are authoritative truth (kept in sync by atomic writes).
 * - `external`: Cherry only references a user-provided path (`externalPath`).
 *   `name` / `ext` are pure projections of `externalPath` (basename / extname) —
 *   stable as long as the reference itself is stable. The BO has **no `size`
 *   field** for external entries (consumers needing a live value call File IPC
 *   `getMetadata(id)`, which runs `fs.stat` on demand; see rationale below).
 *
 * Timestamps are numbers (ms epoch) matching DB integer storage.
 * For file reference types, see `./ref/`.
 *
 * ## Field presence per variant
 *
 * | Field         | origin='internal'                  | origin='external'                              |
 * |---------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
 * | `name`        | SoT (user renamable)               | derived from `externalPath` basename (stable)  |
 * | `ext`         | SoT                                | derived from `externalPath` extname (stable)   |
 * | `size`        | SoT (bytes, ≥ 0)                   | **absent** — live value via `getMetadata`      |
 * | `externalPath`| **absent**                         | non-null absolute path (canonical)             |
 * | `deletedAt`   | optional (present iff trashed)     | **absent** (external cannot be trashed)        |
 *
 * "Absent" means the field is not declared on that variant's schema at all —
 * `entry.size` is a type error on the external arm, not `null` you have to
 * defend against. The DB still carries every column (see "DB row vs Business
 * Object"), but those `null`s are stripped at the BO boundary.
 *
 * ## Why external has no `size`
 *
 * External files can change outside Cherry at any time (user edits, another app
 * overwrites, the file gets moved). Storing a snapshot here would create two
 * classes of bugs: (a) callers silently consuming stale values, (b) "refresh"
 * operations that merely move the staleness window. Dropping `size` from the
 * external BO forces consumers to make the freshness tradeoff explicit — either
 * they don't need it, or they call `getMetadata` for a live `fs.stat`. `name` /
 * `ext` stay on the variant because they are pure projections of `externalPath`
 * (which is the SoT) and therefore cannot drift while the entry exists; the
 * cost of recomputing `path.basename` on every row is not worth the
 * denormalization saving.
 *
 * ## Type safety: Zod brand on FileEntry
 *
 * `FileEntrySchema` is branded so arbitrary object literals cannot satisfy
 * the `FileEntry` type. Only values that have passed `FileEntrySchema.parse()`
 * (or `.safeParse()` with success) carry the brand. This forces entry
 * production through sanctioned paths (FileManager `createInternalEntry` /
 * `ensureExternalEntry` IPC, DataApi handler row→DTO conversion, FileMigrator
 * insert) which own the derivation of `name`/`ext`/`size`/etc.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * Internal entries:
 *
 * ```
 *                  ┌──────────┐
 *        ┌────────│  Active   │←───────┐
 *        │        └────┬─────┘        │
 *        │             │ trash()      │ restore()
 *        │             ▼              │
 *        │        ┌──────────┐        │
 *        │        │ Trashed  │────────┘
 *        │        └────┬─────┘
 *        │             │ permanentDelete()
 *        │             ▼
 *        │        ┌──────────┐
 *        └───────→│ Deleted  │
 *  permanentDelete└──────────┘
 * ```
 *
 * External entries are monotonic — no Trashed state:
 *
 * ```
 *   ensureExternalEntry   ┌──────────┐   permanentDelete   ┌──────────┐
 *   ────────────────────→│  Active   │───────────────────→│ Deleted  │
 *                         └──────────┘                     └──────────┘
 *                         (update in place via rename / write)
 * ```
 *
 * - Active:   `deletedAt` is absent — on `InternalEntrySchema` it's `optional`
 *             so omitted means live; `ExternalEntrySchema` doesn't declare the
 *             field at all and the DB `fe_external_no_delete` CHECK enforces it
 *             at the row layer
 * - Trashed:  `deletedAt = <ms epoch>` (internal-only)
 * - permanentDelete on internal: unlink FS file + delete DB row
 * - permanentDelete on external: **DB row only** — the physical file is left
 *   untouched. Entry-level deletion is decoupled from physical deletion;
 *   callers wanting to delete the file on disk should invoke the path-level
 *   unmanaged `@main/utils/file/fs.remove(path)` separately.

// ─── Canonical External Path (TS phantom brand) ───

/**
 * A `string` already processed through `canonicalizeExternalPath`.
 *
 * This is a **TypeScript-only phantom brand** (zero runtime cost, zero wire
 * cost) that acts as a compile-time guard for every DB read/write surface on
 * `externalPath`: any query entry point that filters by `externalPath` MUST
 * narrow its input to this type, which forces callers through
 * `canonicalizeExternalPath()` instead of accepting a raw user path.
 *
 * ## Why a brand and not runtime validation
 *
 * The correctness invariant — "the string equals `canonicalizeExternalPath(x)`
 * for some `x`" — cannot be verified at runtime without re-running
 * canonicalization, which would defeat the purpose. The brand expresses
 * "this value was produced by the authorized factory" structurally, so the
 * type system (not runtime checks) enforces the contract.
 *
 * ## Authorized construction
 *
 * - **Production code**: only `canonicalizeExternalPath()` in
 *   `src/main/services/file/utils/pathResolver.ts` may produce values of this type.
 *   Other production code importing `CanonicalExternalPath` MUST receive it
 *   from that function (directly or transitively) — never via `as` cast.
 * - **Tests and fixtures**: may cast known-canonical string literals with
 *   `'/abs/path' as CanonicalExternalPath` for readability.
 * - **DB rows**: the `externalPath` column is typed as `string | null` in
 *   Drizzle (SQLite has no brand concept); upcasting into
 *   `CanonicalExternalPath` at the service boundary is acceptable because
 *   writes on that column already go through the canonicalization path.

 * the `FilePath` template-literal shape** (so it can flow into any
 * `@main/utils/file/*` API without a cast).
 *
 * Round 2 S5: the schema's `externalPath` field used to be plain
 * `AbsolutePathSchema` (inferred as `string`), forcing five production
 * sites to `as FilePath`-cast at every read. The schema now `refine`s
 * against `canonicalizeAbsolutePath` (real runtime check; rejects any
 * non-canonical input at parse time) and then `transform`s the result
 * into this intersection — so consumers reading `entry.externalPath`
 * get a value typed exactly as they need it, with the canonical
 * provenance proven at the schema boundary.

// ─── FileEntry Schema (discriminated union on origin, branded) ───
//
// ## DB row vs Business Object
//
// The `file_entry` SQLite table is a flat row with all columns physically
// present (size / externalPath / deletedAt are all nullable on the column
// level), guarded by three CHECK constraints (`fe_origin_consistency`,
// `fe_size_internal_only`, `fe_external_no_delete`) so a row can never
// represent an impossible combination. That is the **DB-row** layer.
//
// `FileEntry` is the **business object** consumers actually work with.
// Discrimination on `origin` means an internal entry doesn't *have* an
// `externalPath`, and an external entry doesn't *have* a `size` /
// `deletedAt` — these fields are simply absent on the BO shape, not `null`.
// Narrowing on `origin` gives TS the right keys at the right callsite,
// so renderer code never has to `if (entry.origin === 'internal') ...`
// just to access `entry.size`, and never has to `as` a `null` check away.
//
// `rowToFileEntry` is the translation layer: take a DB row, switch on
// `origin`, build the variant-specific plain object (dropping the null
// columns that don't belong on that variant), then run
// `FileEntrySchema.parse` to get the brand back. The DB CHECK constraints
// and the BO schema express the same invariants from two layers.
