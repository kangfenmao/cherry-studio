/**
 * Canonical set of entity types that participate in cross-cutting features
 * (tagging, grouping, pinning). Single source of truth for schema validation
 * of entityType discriminators. DB storage is still `text()` on each table —
 * this enum enforces the value at the API boundary via Zod.
 *
 * Design note (intentionally flat, shared across tag/group/pin):
 * - All three features share this enum and `EntityIdSchema` below. Adding a
 *   value here opens it to all three at the schema boundary — there is no
 *   per-feature gating and no cross-field check between entityType and entityId.
 * - Cross-field correctness is a renderer-hook contract: each feature's hook
 *   (`usePins`, `useTags`, `useGroups`, ...) emits the entityId shape that
 *   matches its entityType. The schema does not re-verify this.
 * - The DB and downstream services tolerate stray combinations gracefully:
 *   pin / entity_tag / group rows have no FK to consumer tables, so an orphan
 *   row from a misuse just renders as an unresolved item the user can remove.
 * - This is deliberate: internal DataApi callers are our own typed renderer code,
 *   so we trust the renderer-side contract instead of paying for a second layer
 *   of schema-level cross-field validation.
