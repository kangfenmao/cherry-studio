 * Custom SQL statements that Drizzle cannot manage

 * Drizzle ORM doesn't track:

 * - Triggers
 * - Custom indexes with expressions

 * All statements must be idempotent (use IF NOT EXISTS, etc.)
 *
 * To add new custom SQL:
 * 1. Create statements in the relevant schema file (e.g., messageFts.ts)
 * 2. Import and spread them into CUSTOM_SQL_STATEMENTS below
