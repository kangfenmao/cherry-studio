# Data Service Utils

This directory holds **shared utility functions used by the data-service layer**. These utilities have a well-defined responsibility boundary and are not project-wide utilities.

Before using, read the [Row → Entity Mapping](../../../../../docs/references/data/data-api-in-main.md#row--entity-mapping) section of `data-api-in-main.md` to understand the service-layer paradigm and conventions (what `rowToEntity` looks like, when to use `nullsToUndefined`, etc.). The section below captures the design-decision history behind these utilities.

## File Index

### `rowMappers.ts` — Row → Entity mapping utilities

Serves each Service's `rowToEntity` function, performing the boundary translation from a SQLite row to a domain entity.

**Exports:**

#### `nullsToUndefined<T>(obj: T): { [K in keyof T]: null extends T[K] ? Exclude<T[K], null> | undefined : T[K] }`

Shallowly replaces top-level `null` values in the object with `undefined`, preserving all other values.

**Design boundaries:**

- **Shallow**: iterates top-level fields only; does not recurse into nested objects or arrays
- **Replace, not delete**: the returned object keeps every original field (value becomes `undefined`); it does not produce a `Partial<T>`
- **SQLite-column-boundary only**: designed for column NULL → TS undefined translation; `null` should not appear inside JSON payloads (if it does, fix the Zod schema instead)
- **Precise typing**: only fields whose type includes `null` are narrowed to `Exclude<T, null> | undefined`; `notNull()` columns pass through unchanged. This matches runtime reality — a `notNull()` column cannot produce `undefined` at this boundary.

**Example:**

```ts
import { nullsToUndefined } from './rowMappers'

const row = { id: 'x', name: 'MCP-1', description: null, timeout: null }
const clean = nullsToUndefined(row)
// clean = { id: 'x', name: 'MCP-1', description: undefined, timeout: undefined }
// type: { id: string; name: string; description: string | undefined; timeout: number | undefined }
```

#### `timestampToISO(value: number | Date): string`

Convert a guaranteed-present timestamp (millisecond epoch) to an ISO string. Use when the input type is already narrowed to `number | Date` — typically for `.notNull()` columns or post-validation values.

**Why the signature rejects `null | undefined`:** `new Date(null).toISOString()` silently returns the Unix epoch (`"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"`). Letting the type system refuse `null | undefined` at the call site turns a silent bug into a compile error.

**Behavioral note on `0`:** `0` is a legitimate timestamp (Unix epoch); this helper passes it through. This differs from `timestampToISOOrUndefined` which treats `0` as falsy.

#### `timestampToISOOrUndefined(value: number | Date | null | undefined): string | undefined`

Convert an optional DB timestamp to an ISO string, preserving absence as `undefined`. Reserved for construction paths where the **entire source row may not exist** — not "this column might be null". The audit columns `createdAt` / `updatedAt` are DB-level `NOT NULL` (see `createUpdateTimestamps` in `_columnHelpers.ts`), so a row read from the DB always has real values.

The canonical use case is a merge between a builtin/preset definition and an optional DB preference row:

```ts
function builtinToMiniApp(def: BuiltinMiniAppDefinition, dbRow?: MiniAppSelect): MiniApp {
  return {
    /* ... builtin fields ... */
    createdAt: timestampToISOOrUndefined(dbRow?.createdAt), // undefined when builtin has no preference row yet
    updatedAt: timestampToISOOrUndefined(dbRow?.updatedAt)
  }
}
```

**Behavioral note on `0`:** the helper treats `0` as falsy (matching the prior `row.x ? ... : undefined` idiom). Zero is not a valid business timestamp in this codebase.

**Picking between the two helpers:**

| Scenario | Call-site pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Standard `rowToEntity` reading a DB row (audit columns are `.notNull()`) | `timestampToISO(row.createdAt)` |
| Merge path where the source row itself may be absent (e.g. builtin + optional preference) | `timestampToISOOrUndefined(dbRow?.createdAt)` |

**Example:**

```ts
import { timestampToISO, timestampToISOOrUndefined } from './rowMappers'

timestampToISO(1700000000000)                       // "2023-11-14T22:13:20.000Z"
timestampToISO(0)                                   // "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" (passes through)

timestampToISOOrUndefined(1700000000000)            // "2023-11-14T22:13:20.000Z"
timestampToISOOrUndefined(undefined)                // undefined (e.g. builtin with no preference row)
```

### `orderKey.ts` — `order_key` column runtime operations

Backs every Service's reorder write path and POST-create. Encapsulates the `fractional-indexing` library, transactional SQL, and scope filtering behind a small set of wrappers. Required in all service POST-create and reorder paths; migrator helpers and migration scripts re-import from here.

**Exports:**

- `generateOrderKeySequence(count)` / `generateOrderKeyBetween(before, after)` / `generateOrderKeySequenceBetween(before, after, count)` — the ONLY wrappers around `fractional-indexing` in this codebase. Migrator helpers and migration scripts re-import from here.
- `insertWithOrderKey(tx, table, values, { pkColumn, position?, scope? })` — the only correct entry for POST-create endpoints on sortable tables; never write `tx.insert(table).values(...)` directly.
- `insertManyWithOrderKey(tx, table, valuesList, { pkColumn, position?, scope? })` — batch variant. Does ONE boundary-key lookup and ONE bulk `INSERT .. RETURNING` for N rows. Preferred whenever creating ≥2 rows at once (bulk imports, multi-row service ops). `insertWithOrderKey` internally delegates to it.
- `applyMoves(tx, table, moves, { pkColumn, scope? })` — the only correct entry for reorder operations (batch + single). Dedups duplicate ids (keeps last, warns). Contract rejections surface as `DataApiError`: missing target id → `NOT_FOUND`, missing anchor id → `NOT_FOUND`, anchor === own id → `VALIDATION_ERROR`. Resource name in the error is the Drizzle table name. Suitable for both fixed-scope and nullable-scope callers — the consumer constructs `scope?` (e.g. `isNull(col)` or `eq(col, value)`) and propagates the error verbatim.
- `resetOrder(tx, table, orderedRows, { pkColumn })` — paired with `POST /:res/order:reset`; rewrites `orderKey` with a fresh evenly-spaced sequence in the given order.
- `computeNewOrderKey(tx, table, request, { pkColumn, scope? })` — exported only for unit tests.

**Design boundaries:**

- **Only operates on `order_key`**: business validation (does `:id` exist in the resource sense) lives in the service/handler layer, not here.
- **Must run inside an outer transaction**: helpers take `tx` and never open their own transaction.
- **`scope?` (SQL)**: constrains neighbor queries to a subset for partial ordering (e.g. `topic.groupId`, `userModel.providerId`). Scope applies to BOTH the target lookup and the anchor lookup — anchoring across scopes throws.
- **`pkColumn` is required**: tables have heterogeneous primary-key column names (`miniapp.appId`, `mcpServer.id`, `topic.id`, `group.id`). Helpers make zero assumptions.
- **External imports of `fractional-indexing` are forbidden**: always go through the three generator wrappers above.
- **Character set is locked to base62** (library default); no `digits` parameter is exposed. Changing the alphabet requires a whole-database migration, and the source-of-truth constant lives at the top of `orderKey.ts`.

### `ftsSearch.ts` — FTS cursor, filtering, and pagination core

Shared by full-text search services that use SQLite FTS5 trigram tables. It
owns the common opaque cursor codec, trigram-FTS candidate filtering, literal
regex revalidation, bounded offset scanning, and next-cursor assembly.

**FTS contract:**

- The caller's SQL must join its FTS5 virtual table aliased as `fts`.
- The FTS table must be created with `tokenize='trigram'` and expose a
  `searchable_text` column.
- The utility builds `fts.searchable_text LIKE ...` conditions and the caller
  inserts those conditions into its own SQL shape.

**Design boundaries:**

- **SQL shape stays with the owning service**: callers provide the raw SQL
  query and row mapper because each domain joins different tables.
- **Read-only search only**: this utility never writes, opens transactions, or
  applies domain ownership rules.
- **Snippet construction is injected**: callers decide how to build display
  snippets from matched text and terms.
- **Cursor sort keys are caller-owned**: `mapRow` returns the public item plus
  the `(createdAt, id)` boundary used to assemble `nextCursor`.
- **Candidate scans are bounded**: LIKE candidates that fail regex
  revalidation stop at the configured ceiling and log a warning instead of
  scanning an entire FTS table for one page.
- **Role coercion is caller-owned**: role subsets live with the message domain
  in `@shared/data/types/message`; this generic utility does not know message
  roles.

## Criteria for Adding a New Utility

Before adding a new utility to this directory, confirm:

1. **Has at least two real consumers** (history: `stripNulls` qualified because `MiniAppService` had made a copy-paste duplicate)
2. **Do not extract simple single-field operations**: operations like `value ?? undefined` are already well-covered by TypeScript itself — do not wrap them
3. **Does not duplicate an existing third-party library** (e.g. lodash) — unless we have specific boundary constraints
4. **Add a new entry to the "File Index" above** documenting responsibility, signature, boundaries, and an example

## Rejected Alternatives

The following approaches to the "SQLite NULL ↔ TypeScript optional" bridge were evaluated and rejected. **Do not re-propose them** unless you have new evidence that invalidates the reason given; if so, cite the data explicitly.

| Approach | Reason for rejection |
| --- | --- |
| Change domain types to `T \| null`, removing the bridge layer | Violates Google TS Style Guide; leaks `null` into the renderer; complicates IPC serialization; requires rewriting all of `shared/types` |
| Use a Drizzle custom column type with `fromDriver(null) → undefined` | Conflicts with Drizzle's type inference; high invasiveness; only saves one `nullsToUndefined` call |
| Adopt the `dnull` third-party library | Inactive maintenance (weekly 686 downloads, maintenance: inactive); recursive deep conversion is an over-match that swallows legitimate `null` values |
| Turn `nullsToUndefined` into a recursive version | Column level is the only source of physical `null`; recursion would swallow legitimate business `null` inside JSON payloads; wasted CPU on large payloads |
| Use `.notNull()` + empty-string default to eliminate `null` at schema level | Explicitly flagged as an anti-pattern by the Drizzle community ([discussion #1086](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/discussions/1086)) — "masks the real problem" |
| Extract a single-field `nullToUndefined<T>(value)` helper | TS `??` already narrows types at the expression level; function wrapping adds no runtime or type benefit |
