/**
 * Terminology — read this before editing
 * --------------------------------------
 *
 * "userData" in this file always refers to Electron's
 * `app.getPath('userData')` directory tree — the OS-level directory where
 * Chromium and Electron persist their state alongside whatever the
 * application chooses to put there.
 *
 * It does NOT mean "user data" in the colloquial Chinese sense (用户数据).
 * The Electron userData directory contains BOTH:
 *
 *   - User content    (cherrystudio.sqlite, Data/Files, Data/KnowledgeBase,
 *                      Data/Notes, Cookies, etc.)
 *   - Chromium runtime state  (Network/, Partitions/webview/Network/,
 *                              IndexedDB, Local Storage, Service Worker, ...)
 *   - Application logs   (logs/, written by winston)
 *
 * When this file says "copy the userData directory" or "the userData has
 * been relocated", it means **the entire OS directory** is being moved as
 * a single opaque tree — not a curated subset of "user content".
 *
 * v1 used to distinguish "occupied dirs" (logs/Network/Partitions, locked
 * by the running process on Windows) from the rest, and copy them in two
 * separate phases. v2 abandons that distinction: the entire directory is
 * copied at startup, when the previous process has fully exited and no
 * file is locked. See `src/renderer/config/constant.ts:occupiedDirs`
 * for the deprecated v1 constant.

 * across runs. Must match v1 init.ts:51-60 / 93-101 behavior so migrated
 * data resolves.
 *

/**
 * Resolve where the Electron userData directory should live, applying any
 * pending relocation along the way, and call app.setPath('userData', ...).
 *
 * Timing constraint: MUST run before `application.bootstrap()` is called.
 * The constraint is documented in Application.ts:119-126 — bootstrap()
 * invokes buildPathRegistry() at its entry, which freezes the path
 * registry by reading app.getPath('userData'). All app.setPath() calls
 * must have completed before that point.
 *
 * Logic order:
 *
 *   1. If BootConfig has a `pending` relocation request, execute it now
 *      (synchronously copy from → to). On success, commit the new location
 *      to `app.user_data_path` and clear the request. On failure, mark
 *      the request as `failed` — the user keeps running on the previous
 *      location until they decide what to do via a future renderer
 *      recovery flow.
 *
 *   2. Resolve the userData location from `app.user_data_path[exe]`.
 *      If valid, setPath. Otherwise fall through.
 *
 *   3. Portable fallback for Windows portable builds.
 *
 *   4. Fall through to Electron default.
 *
 * Normal-flow path: BootConfig is the single source of truth. The v1→v2
 * migration handles its own userData detection inside the migration
 * system — do NOT add fallbacks to v1 config.json here.
 *
 * Dev (unpackaged) runs take a separate, much simpler branch: append a
 * 'Dev' suffix to Electron's default userData so the dev process can't
 * pollute production data. BootConfig and pending relocations do not
 * apply in dev — they're packaged-only concerns.

/**
 * Execute a pending userData relocation by copying the entire `from` tree
 * to `to`, then committing the new location to BootConfig.
 *
 * Synchronous — preboot is a single-threaded sync phase, so the main
 * process is blocked during the copy. There is no progress UI in this
 * implementation; a future PR will introduce a dedicated relocation
 * window (owned by the renderer) for progress reporting and for handling
 * the `failed` recovery flow.
 *
 * Failure handling: if anything throws (pre-flight check or cpSync), the
 * error is recorded in BootConfig as a `failed` transient state and the
 * function returns normally. resolveUserDataLocation() will then fall
 * through to the existing `app.user_data_path` value (the OLD path), so
 * the user can keep using the app while the failure awaits user action.
 *
 * Known limitation — logger does not follow the relocation:
 *   LoggerService opens its winston file transport at module-load time,
 *   pointing at `app.getPath('logs')` — which on Windows/Linux resolves
 *   to `<userData>/logs`. This happens *before* preboot runs, so the
 *   winston file handle is bound to the OLD userData's logs directory.
 *   After we call setPath('userData', <new>) in Step 2 of
 *   resolveUserDataLocation, `app.getPath('logs')` starts returning the
 *   new path, but winston continues writing to the handle it already
 *   opened at the old path. Post-relocation logs therefore appear at the
 *   OLD location, not the new one, until the next restart.
 *
 *   This is a pre-existing v2 issue (LoggerService doesn't respond to
 *   setPath) and is out of scope for this PR. A follow-up should either
 *   lazy-open winston transports or teach LoggerService to rotate on
 *   userData change. The cpSync *does* copy the snapshot of logs at the
 *   moment of copy, so the new location starts with a historical log
 *   archive — it just won't receive new entries until the next start.
