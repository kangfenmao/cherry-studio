 *    maintained in the idle queue, actively replenished on every `open()` via
 *    `setImmediate`. This guarantees zero-wait for the next caller regardless
 *    of concurrent usage, matching the "warm pool" pattern (AWS EC2 Warm Pools,
 *    RAID hot spares, GPU triple buffering).
 *
 * 2. **Consumer axis (recycle):** `recycleMinSize` / `recycleMaxSize` govern
 *    what happens when a window is closed — push to idle for reuse (bounded by
 *    `recycleMaxSize`) or destroy, with `recycleMinSize` acting as a passive
 *    floor for decay-based eviction.
 *
 * Field dimensions: all `*Size` fields are counts; `decayInterval` and
 * `inactivityTimeout` are seconds. `standbySize` is compared against idle count,
 * while `recycleMaxSize` / `initialSize` are compared against managed count
 * (in-use + idle).
 *
 * **Important:** `standbySize` is NOT bound by `recycleMaxSize`. The pool may
 * temporarily have `managed = in-use + standbySize` windows during bursts
 * where in-use exceeds `recycleMaxSize`; close paths converge back over time.
 *
 * See `docs/references/window-manager/window-manager-warmup-mechanics.md` for the
 * full behavior matrix and scenario walk-throughs.
