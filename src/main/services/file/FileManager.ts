/**
 * FileManager — sole public entry point for all file operations.
 *
 * Registered as a lifecycle service (`@Injectable('FileManager')`,
 * `@ServicePhase(Phase.WhenReady)`); resolved at runtime via
 * `application.get('FileManager')`.
 *
 * Every FileEntry has an `origin`:
 * - `internal`: Cherry owns the content (stored at `{userData}/Data/Files/{id}.{ext}`)
 * - `external`: Cherry references a user-provided absolute path
 *
 * ## Facade pattern
 *
 * FileManager is a **thin facade** — it exposes the public IPC-backed API and
 * delegates every method to pure-function modules under `./internal/*`. The
 * class only owns:
 * - lifecycle (`onInit` / `onStop`; IPC handler registration via `BaseService`)
 * - per-instance `versionCache` (LRU backing `writeIfUnchanged` / `getVersion`)
 * - `FileHandle.kind` dispatch at the IPC boundary
 *
 * External Main callers go through the lifecycle-managed singleton via
 * `application.get('FileManager')`. The `internal/*` tree is a private
 * implementation area and is not re-exported via `src/main/services/file/index.ts`.
 *
 * See `docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md §1.6` for the full
 * implementation-layout decision.
 *
 * ## FileHandle dispatch at the IPC boundary
 *
 * FileManager's public API (below) is **entry-native** — every method takes a
 * `FileEntryId`. Main-side business services call it directly without having
 * to wrap ids in a handle.
 *
 * At the IPC boundary, the renderer speaks `FileHandle` (a tagged union whose
 * variants select the *reference form* — `FileEntryHandle` routes through the
 * entry system, `FilePathHandle` hits `@main/utils/file/*` directly). The
 * design plan is for the IPC adapter to dispatch on `handle.kind` via a
 * `dispatchHandle` helper, with the dispatch logic treated as the adapter's
 * legitimate responsibility (translating request shape), not business
 * orchestration.
 *
 * **Current status (through Batch 0)**: `dispatchHandle` lives in
 * `internal/dispatch.ts` and is wired by exactly one IPC handler today —
 * `File_PermanentDelete`, which accepts a `FileHandle` and routes
 * `{ kind: 'entry' }` to `FileManager.permanentDelete` and `{ kind: 'path' }`
 * to `@main/utils/file/fs.remove`. The Phase 1 dangling channels
 * (`File_GetDanglingState` / `File_BatchGetDanglingStates`) and the Phase 2
 * entry-shaped channels (`File_CreateInternalEntry`, `File_EnsureExternalEntry`,
 * `File_GetPhysicalPath`) take typed params directly and bypass the dispatcher
 * because their semantics are entry-only by design. When `FileHandle`-accepting
 * read/write/metadata channels land in later batches, they will follow the
 * same pattern as `File_PermanentDelete`:
 *
 * - `{ kind: 'entry', entryId }` → the corresponding FileManager public
 *   method (e.g. `this.read(entryId, opts)`)
 * - `{ kind: 'path', path }`     → the `*ByPath` variant exported from
 *   `internal/*` (e.g. `contentRead.readByPath(deps, path, opts)`)
 *
 * `*ByPath` variants are not exposed on the FileManager class — Main-side
 * callers have no use for them (they hold FileEntry, not arbitrary paths).
 *
 * New handle kinds (e.g. `virtual` for zip members) extend `dispatchHandle`
 * and each IPC handler within this file; the public API surface and
 * `internal/*` pure-function structure both stay stable.
 *
 * See `docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md §1.6.5` for the
 * full dispatch convention.
 *
 * ## External entries — best-effort reference semantics
 *
 * External entries represent "the caller expressed an intention to reference
 * this path at some point in time". Cherry does not track external renames/
 * moves; external filesystem changes surface naturally as "read returns new
 * content" or "entry becomes dangling".
 *
 * Which callers use internal vs external is a business-layer decision —
 * FileManager makes no assumption. For module boundaries and dangling-state
 * tracking, see:
 * - [file-manager-architecture.md](../../../docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md)
 * - [architecture.md](../../../docs/references/file/architecture.md)
 *
 * Cherry **allows** user-initiated modification of external files:
 * - `write` / `writeIfUnchanged` → atomic write to `externalPath`
 * - `rename` → `fs.rename` + update DB
 *
 * Cherry **never** modifies external files automatically. Specifically:
 * - No watcher-driven writebacks
 * - No background sync
 * - No tracking of external rename/move
 * - `permanentDelete` on an external file_entry removes only the DB row — this
 *   entry-level operation is deliberately decoupled from physical deletion.
 *   Path-level deletion remains available via `remove(path)` from
 *   `@main/utils/file/fs` (reached through a `FilePathHandle`), which is an
 *   explicit user-facing operation not tied to any entry id.
 *
 * **External entries cannot be trashed.** Their lifecycle is monotonic:
 * created by `ensureExternalEntry` (pure upsert keyed by path — see below),
 * updated in place via `write` / `rename`, and removed only by an explicit
 * (non-UI) `permanentDelete`. The `fe_external_no_delete` CHECK constraint
 * enforces this at the DB level; `trash` / `restore` on an external entry id
 * will throw.
 *
 * `ensureExternalEntry` is a pure upsert on the `externalPath` global unique
 * index: existing entry at the same path is reused; otherwise a new row is
 * inserted. No "restore trashed" branch — trashed external entries cannot
 * exist. External rows carry no stored `size` (always `null`); consumers
 * needing a live value call `getMetadata(id)`.
 *
 * Dangling state is tracked by the file_module's `DanglingCache` singleton,
 * not by FileManager itself. FileManager ops mutate the cache asymmetrically:
 *
 * - **Failed stat (ENOENT) on external** — commits `'missing'` through the
 *   `observeExternalAccess` chokepoint (`internal/observe.ts`). Covers read,
 *   getContentHash, getMetadata, getVersion; `createReadStream` mirrors the
 *   same transition through a `'error'` listener on the stream.
 * - **Successful create / ensureExternal / rename** — explicitly pushes
 *   `'present'` (via `addEntry` + `onFsEvent(..., 'present', 'ops')`) so the
 *   cache learns presence from the producer side.
 * - **Successful read / hash / stat** — does NOT touch the cache. The cache
 *   learns `'present'` from the watcher or from explicit ops-side writes,
 *   never from passive reads (see `observe.ts` semantics).
 *
 * Reading "ops update the cache on every stat" would suggest a symmetric
 * fresh-stat-flip-to-present rule, which would defeat the watcher-led
 * design. The asymmetry above is the actual contract.

/**
 * Best-effort identity of a file's current on-disk state, captured from

 *
 * ## Precision caveat
 *
 * `mtime` resolution is **filesystem-dependent**:
 * - APFS / ext4 / NTFS (local) — typically nanosecond / millisecond precision
 * - FAT32 / exFAT / SMB / NFS — **second-precision** (any sub-second change is
 *   invisible to `mtime` alone)
 *
 * Combined with a same-size edit, a second-precision `FileVersion` comparison
 * can **silently mis-identify two different files as equal**. `writeIfUnchanged`
 * would then run over "stale" data without tripping `StaleVersionError`.
 *
 * ## Opt-in hash fallback
 *
 * `writeIfUnchanged` accepts an optional `expectedContentHash` (xxhash-h64 hex
 * of the content the caller last observed). When supplied AND the observed
 * mtime is ambiguous (ms === 0 AND size matches), the implementation re-hashes
 * the file on disk and throws `StaleVersionError` on mismatch. When omitted
 * (the default), `writeIfUnchanged` proceeds optimistically under reduced
 * mtime precision — the same behavior as on sub-second filesystems.
 *
 * `FileVersion` itself intentionally excludes the hash: the hot path
 * (read → sub-second-precision compare) should not pay for hash computation,
 * and `createReadStream` cannot produce a hash without breaking its lazy
 * pipeline. Callers that need strict OCC on second-precision filesystems
 * compute and supply the hash per-call.

 * Atomic write stream: buffered to a tmp file until `.end()` commits the write

 *   back-pressure semantics (return value `false` = pause until `'drain'`).
 * - `.end(chunk?)` — finalises the tmp file, fsyncs, then `rename(tmp → target)`.
 *   On success emits `'finish'`; on failure emits `'error'` after attempting
 *   to unlink the tmp file. This is the **commit path** — no rename happens
 *   on any other terminal transition.
 * - `.destroy(err?)` — abnormal termination (Node stream convention). The
 *   implementation treats this the same as `.abort()` + error propagation:
 *   no rename, tmp file is unlinked best-effort.
 * - `.abort()` — explicit cancel. Unlinks the tmp file and resolves once
 *   cleanup completes. Idempotent. Preferred over `.destroy()` when the
 *   caller wants to discard the write deliberately (e.g. validation failed)
 *   — `.abort()` returns a promise that awaits the unlink, while `.destroy()`

 *   - DanglingCache surface (`getDanglingState` /
