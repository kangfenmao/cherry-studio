/**
 * `toFileInfo(entry)` — project a managed `FileEntry` into a live, on-disk
 * `FileInfo` descriptor.
 *
 * Resolves the entry's physical path via `resolvePhysicalPath`, runs `fs.stat`
 * for live size/mtime, and derives mime/type from the entry's extension.
 *
 * ## Projection is one-way
 *
 * `FileEntry → FileInfo` is a snapshot-to-live projection — each call re-reads
 * `fs.stat`. There is no corresponding `FileInfo → FileEntry` conversion: the
 * reverse is a *state change* that must go through sanctioned FileManager
 * factories (`createInternalEntry` / `ensureExternalEntry`). The Zod brand on
 * `FileEntrySchema` enforces this at compile time.
 *
 * ## Failure modes
 *
 * - External entry whose file has been removed → `ENOENT` is surfaced. Callers
 *   that need the dangling cache to update should go through `FileManager`,
 *   which wraps this function.
 * - Internal entry missing on disk → a bug. The error propagates for visibility.
 *
 * @see FileInfo (src/shared/file/types/info.ts) for the data shape.
 * @see architecture.md §2 for the reference-vs-data-shape design.
