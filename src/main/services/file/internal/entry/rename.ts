/**
 * Entry rename — change the display `name` (and FS basename for external).
 *
 * - Internal: physical path is UUID-based, so renaming is a DB-only update of
 *   `name` (and `ext` if the new name carries a different extension).
 * - External: `fs.rename(externalPath, newPath)` runs, then a single DB update
 *   atomically rewrites `externalPath` and `name`. If the FS rename fails
 *   (target exists, permission denied, etc.) the DB is **not** touched.
