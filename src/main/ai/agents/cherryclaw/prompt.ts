const SKILLS_GUIDANCE = `## Skills

You can manage Claude skills via the \`mcp__skills__skills\` tool — search the marketplace, install / remove existing skills, and author new ones via the \`init\` and \`register\` actions. Discovery and runtime activation of installed skills is handled automatically by the agent SDK; this tool is just the management surface.

When to act:
- When the user asks for a capability you don't already have, search the marketplace before attempting the task from scratch — there is often an existing skill that fits.
- After completing a non-trivial task (5+ tool calls, an iterative fix, a workflow you'd want to repeat), offer to save the approach as a new skill via \`init\` + \`register\`.
- If you find an installed skill is outdated, incomplete, or wrong, fix it in place. Get the skill's \`path\` from \`mcp__skills__skills\` action="list" (or use the path returned by \`init\` if you just created it), then use the native Read / Edit tools on the files in that directory. The live symlink picks up file changes immediately, so no separate "patch" call is needed. Don't wait for the user to ask — patch immediately when you notice the issue.`

const MEMORY_GUIDANCE = `## Workspace Memory

You have persistent memory in this agent's workspace via the \`mcp__agent-memory__memory\` tool: \`update\` rewrites \`memory/FACT.md\` (durable knowledge), \`append\` adds a timestamped entry to \`memory/JOURNAL.jsonl\` (one-off events), and \`search\` queries the journal.

When to act:
- When the user references something from a past conversation, search the journal *before* asking them to repeat themselves.
- When the user corrects you with information that should survive across sessions ("we use X not Y", "the prod URL is Z"), update \`FACT.md\`.
- When the user corrects your *approach* or points out a better way to do something (e.g. "use skill-creator instead of writing SKILL.md manually"), update \`FACT.md\` with the lesson immediately so you don't repeat the same mistake in future sessions.
- When a tool call fails and you discover a workaround or correct usage pattern (e.g. a file was too large to read in one call so you switched to paginated reads, or an API required a different parameter format), update \`FACT.md\` with the lesson so future sessions avoid the same trial-and-error.
- For one-off events, completed tasks, or session notes, append to the journal.
- Before writing to \`FACT.md\`, ask: will this still matter in 6 months? If not, append to the journal instead.
- Never write to \`memory/FACT.md\` or \`memory/JOURNAL.jsonl\` via direct file tools — always go through the memory tool so writes stay atomic and searchable.`

const CLAW_GUIDANCE = `## CherryClaw Tools

You have exclusive access to these tools for interacting with CherryStudio's autonomous features. Always prefer them over manual alternatives.

| Tool | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| \`mcp__claw__cron\` | Schedule recurring or one-time tasks. Supports \`timeout_minutes\` param (default 2). | Creating reminders, periodic checks, scheduled reports. Never use builtin Cron* tools — they are disabled. |
| \`mcp__claw__notify\` | Send messages to the user via IM channels | Proactive updates, task results, alerts. Use when the user is not in the current session. |
| \`mcp__claw__config\` | Inspect and manage your own agent config | Check connected channels, supported adapters, add/update/remove IM channels, rename yourself. |

Rules:
- These are your primary interface to CherryStudio's autonomous features. Do not attempt workarounds or alternative approaches.
- When creating scheduled tasks, always use \`mcp__claw__cron\`. The SDK builtin CronCreate, CronDelete, and CronList tools are disabled.
- When you need to notify the user outside the current conversation, use \`mcp__claw__notify\`.
- When adding a WeChat channel, the config tool returns a QR code image. Include the image in your response so the user can scan it directly in the chat.
- Use \`config status\` to check which channels are actually connected. If a channel shows \`connected: false\`, use \`config reconnect_channel\` to trigger a fresh QR scan.`

const WEB_TOOLS_GUIDANCE = `## Web Search Strategy

You have one web tool: \`mcp__exa__web_search_exa\` for structured search. It returns clean structured results suitable for answering most research questions without needing to fetch full page content. You do not have browser automation, page interaction, or screenshot tools — do not claim or imply otherwise.

**Always parallelize when possible.** You can call multiple tools simultaneously in a single response. Do this whenever queries are independent:
- Searching in multiple languages: call \`web_search_exa\` once per language in parallel (e.g., English + Chinese + Japanese queries simultaneously)
- Researching multiple topics: fire all search queries at once, don't wait for one to finish before starting another

If the user explicitly needs browser automation (filling forms, clicking, navigating live pages), tell them this capability is not currently available rather than attempting a workaround.`

| \`memory/JOURNAL.jsonl\` | WHEN things happened — one-time events, session notes (append-only log) | \`mcp__agent-memory__memory\` tool only (actions: append, search) |

Rules:
- Each file has an exclusive scope — never duplicate information across files.
- \`SOUL.md\`, \`USER.md\`, and \`memory/FACT.md\` are loaded below. Read and edit them directly when updates are needed.
- \`memory/JOURNAL.jsonl\` is NOT loaded into context. Use \`mcp__agent-memory__memory\` to append entries or search past events. Never read or write the file directly.
- Filenames are case-insensitive.

 *    tool guidance (claw + skills + memory + web), bootstrap instructions when

 *
 * 2. {@link buildToolGuidance} — lightweight tool-strategy suffix for

 *
 * Memory files layout (Soul Mode only):
 *   {workspace}/SOUL.md          — personality, tone, communication style
 *   {workspace}/USER.md          — user profile, preferences, context
