/**
 * Internal request features — one bundle per concern. Order matters because
 * AI SDK plugin order is significant (e.g. `reasoning-extraction` must run
 * before `simulate-streaming`; `pdf-compatibility` must run before
 * `anthropic-cache`). Mirrors the prior `PluginBuilder.buildPlugins`
 * decision tree, now expressed as `RequestFeature.applies` gates.
