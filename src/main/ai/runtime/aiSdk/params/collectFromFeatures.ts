/**
 * Phase 1 of the agent-params pipeline: ask each active feature for its
 * contributions and gather them into a flat draft. No cross-feature
 * dependency, no mutation of scope. Phase 2 (defer exposition / system
 * prompt assembly / hook composition) reads this draft.
 *
 * Errors from any feature method are isolated — the contribution is
 * dropped, other features continue, the request still proceeds.
